another day another dollar
if you love something, set it free
tow heads are better than one
I know you are but what am I
an apple a day keeps the doctor away
a little goes a lonw way
what's mine is yours and what's yours is mine
friendship is the greatest treasure of all
action speak louder than words
what doesn't kill you makes you stronger
a promise is a promise
who let the cat out of the bag
knowledge is power
an eye for an eye
the pen is mighier than the sword
silence is golden
sticks and stones may break my bones
a cat nap
