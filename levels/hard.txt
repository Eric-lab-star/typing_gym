All the beauty in the world
Patrick Bringley worked for ten years as a guard in the galleries of the Metropolitan Museum of Art
Previously, he worked in the editorial events office at the New Yorker magazine
He lectures widely at museums and leads public and provate tours of the Met
He lives with his wife and children in Sunset Park, Brooklyn
All the Beauty in the World is his first book
In the basement of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, below the Arms and Armor wing and outside the guards' Dispathc Office, there are stacks of empty art crates
The crates come in all shapes and sizes
some are big and boxy others wide and depthless like paintings, but theyu are uniformly imposing, heavily constructed of pale raw lumber, fit to ship rare treasures or exotic beasts
